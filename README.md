UCI Compliant Chess Engine
This engine, at the time of writing this, is attempting to implement "titboards" as described here: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Titboards . The term "titboards" comes from the abbreviation of ternary boards the same way "bitboards" are binary boards. This is a promising way of generating pseudo-legal sliding piece moves. If successful, this will be the first engine to implement this conceptual move generation method.
