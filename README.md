UCI Compliant Chess Engine
This engine, at the time of writing this, is attempting to implement "titboards" as described here: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Titboards.  Titboards are based on an extension of bitboards to ternary boards, hence the name ("bit" means binary digit, "tit" mean ternary digit. This is a promising way of generating pseudo-legal sliding piece moves. If successful, this will be the first engine to implement this conceptual move generation method.
